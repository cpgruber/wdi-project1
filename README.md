Project 1 - War

1. A player should be able to start a game/get a stack of cards so that they can play War.
2. A player should be able to click their stack so that they can play a card.
3. A player should be able to keep track of how many cards each player has so that they can know the score.
4. A player should be able to restart a game so that they do not have to play until the end (game could take a while to finish)
5. A player should be able to view his/her stack so they can determine if they want to continue the game.
